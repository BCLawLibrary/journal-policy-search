# Law Journal Reposting Policy Search

We aim to consolidate the reposting policies of law journals and law reviews in a single, searchable web app. 

We rely on a public [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT9onUjR4c1Fij1PC_t4p4L-MJWs8-_hJpuvG6KdH-RuoQawme2VR_1b5jBKUtGgbhwfPymKMDeDh7J/pubhtml) as a backend, which we convert from CSV to JSON using [Papa Parse](https://www.papaparse.com/), and we present the data using [DataTables](https://datatables.net/).
